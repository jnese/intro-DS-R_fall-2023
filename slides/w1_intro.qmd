## Introduction to the Course

### Week 1

# Agenda

-   Introductions
-   Syllabus
-   Introduce `R`

**Learning Objectives**

**Research**

* Applied statistical methods to measure and monitor student growth
* Inform the applied research methodologies used by researchers
* Developing and improving systems that support data-based decision making using advanced technologies to influence teachers' instructional practices and increase student achievement 
    + [CORE](https://jnese.github.io/core-blog/) and [CORE II](https://jnese.github.io/coreprosody) 
    + Inclusive Skill-building Learning Approach ([ISLA](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/neselabs/isla/))

**Teaching**

* EDLD 651 - this one!
* EDLD 654 - Applied Machine Learning for Educational Data Scientists

## Why is `R` awesome?

**Data visualizations**

- `{ggplot2}` -- your default by the end of this class, really powerful
- `{plotly}` -- interactive data visualizations 
- `{shiny}` â€“- interactive data communications

. . .

**Web**

- `{blogdown}`, `{distill}`, `{bookdown}`, `quarto` â€“- build your own website
- `{rvest}` â€“- scrape web data

. . .

**Modeling**

- `{lme4}` â€“- multilevel modeling
- `{lavaan}` â€“- SEM
- `{tidymodels}` â€“- machine learning

. . .

**Workflow!**

- RStudio projects
- `{here}`

# This class... {.smaller}

**...is**

- data visualization 
- data structuring and manipulations
- reproducible workflows
- a LOT (content and assignments at a fast pace)

. . .

**...is not**

- all encompassing 
- a statistics course 
    + but we'll use some stats in examples

## Sharing

Sometimes I may ask people to share with the class something they have learned.

- A success, a new `{package}` or `function()`
- *Completely* voluntary
    + **BUT**, you might get a hex sticker ðŸŽ‰

> "I made this cool figure!

> I used the `{gghighlight}` package for the first time!

## Another sharing example
