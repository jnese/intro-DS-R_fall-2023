Create a new RStudio Project and modify the YAML to:\n\n-   Render to html\n-   Change the syntax highlighting to any scheme but the default\n-   Include code folding\n\n#### 2a. Reorder **factors**\n\n-   Get familiar with the `gss_cat` data within the `{forcats}` package.\n-   Remove the rows with missing data in the *tvhours* column.\n-   Calculate the mean *tvhours* by *marital status*.\n-   Display the results as a point plot of average TV consumption by marital status (*tvhours* on the *x*-axis and *martial* on they *y*-axis).\n    -   In your plot, `reorder` the levels of *marital* according to *tvhours*.\n-   Give your plot meaningful axis labels and a title.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### 2b. Working with **tables**\n\n-   Display the same results (mean *tvhours* by *marital status*) as a table using `kable()`.\n    -   Change the column names.\n    -   Round the mean *tvhours* to one decimal.\n    -   Bold the row with the highest mean *tvhours*.\n\n#### 3a. Recode **factors**\n\n-   Use any of the functions we talked about in class to display the levels of the *marital* variable.\n-   `recode` or `collapse` the *marital* column into three categories: \"Not married\", \"Married\", and \"No answer\".\n-   Calculate the mean *tvhours* by *marital status*.\n-   Display the results as a column plot of average TV consumption by marital status (*martial* on the *x*-axis and *tvhours* on they *y*-axis).\n    -   From left to right, the columns in your plot should read: \"Not married\", \"Married\", and \"No answer\".\n-   Make your plot look a little nicer with some color, different theme, meaningful axis labels, and a title.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### 3b. Working with **tables**\n\n-   Display the same results (mean *tvhours* by collapsed *marital status*) as a table using the `{gt}`.\n    -   Change the column names.\n    -   Round the mean *tvhours* to one decimal.\n    -   Highlight in yellow the row with the lowest mean *tvhours*.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-1 .cell tbl-cap='Mean TV Hours/Day by Marital Status'}\n\n:::\n\n\nThis lab borrows from [Garrett Grolemund's](https://resources.rstudio.com/authors/garrett-grolemund) [Remaster the Tidyverse](https://github.com/rstudio-education/remaster-the-tidyverse/) materials.\n",
