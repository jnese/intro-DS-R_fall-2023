It contains data about courses, students, and their interactions with Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) for seven selected courses (called modules). Presentations of courses start in February and October - they are marked by \"B\" and \"J\" respectively. The dataset (tables) are connected using unique identifiers. All datasets are stored in the .csv format. Please check out the [OULAD](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset) site to learn more about the data and understand the keys.\n\n### 1. Start a new RStudio Project\n\n#### 1.1. Be sure to add a folder for \"data\" and \"scripts\".\n\n### 2. Data\n\n#### 2.1. Download the *studentInfo.csv*, *studentAssessment.csv*, and *assessments.csv* data from the [course website](https://jnese.github.io/intro-DS-R-fall-2023/data_list.html).\n\n#### 2.2. Place the files in the \"data\" folder in your project.\n\n#### 2.3. Read in the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### 3. Join\n\n#### 3.1. Join the *studentInfo* data and the *studentAssessment* data. Name the joined data *student*.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### 3.2. What key(s) were used in the join?\n\n\n#### 3.3. How many rows are in this joined data? If that is different than the number of rows in the *studentInfo* data, why?\n\n\n#### 3.3. Join the newly created *student* data with the *assessments* data. Name the joined data *student*.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### 3.4. What key(s) were used in the join?\n\n\n#### 3.5. What new variables were added with this join?\n\n\n### 4. Wrangle\n\n#### 4.1. Create a new dataset named *student_tma* that consists only of TMA (Tutor Marked Assessment) assessments.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### 4.2. Create a new dataset named *student_tma_max* that contains the maximum (`max()`) TMA score for each student. (**Note.** Use `filter` rather than `summarize`.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### 4.3. How many rows are in this joined data? What does each row represent?\n\n\n#### 4.4. Create a dataset named *agg_tma_max* that contains the mean TMA score by \"highest_education\", \"disability\", and \"final_result.\"\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### 5. Plot\n\n#### 5.1. Reproduce the following plot, using any theme and colors you want *except* for the defaults.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
