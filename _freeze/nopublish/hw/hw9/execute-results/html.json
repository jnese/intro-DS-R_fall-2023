Create a new RStudio Project and name it `hw_9`\n\n<br> <br>\n\n#### 2. Within that project, create a new Quarto document and modify the YAML to:\n\n-   Include your name\n-   Render to html\n-   Change the syntax highlighting to any scheme but the default\n-   Include code folding\n-   Include a table of contents\n    -   Use level 1 headers for items (4) through (8) below\n    -   Use level 2 headers for your table and plot in (7) below\n-   Set global chunk options for the document to display and evaluate all code, and not display any warnings or messages\n\n<br> <br>\n\n#### 3. Your first code chunk should:\n\n-   Be labelled `load-packages`\n-   Load all the necessary packages (please don't load packages you do **not** use)\n-   Include options for this code chunk so it will not display the code or the results from the code.\n\n<br> <br>\n\n# 4. Your second code chunk should:\n\n-   Be labelled `load-data`\n-   Import the following three data sets, each as separate objects\n    -   *The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv*\n    -   *The_Two_Towers.csv*\n    -   *The_Return_Of_The_King.csv*\n        -   (These data sets show the **words spoken** by characters of different races and genders in the *Lord of the Ring*s movie trilogy.)\n-   Combine these three data sets into one data set as a new object named `lotr_untidy`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br> <br>\n\n# 5. Describe why the combined data set is not tidy.\n\nThere is information in the column headings, namely sex (male, female).\n\n<br> <br>\n\n# 6. Your third code chunk should:\n\n-   Have a meaningful label (do not use spaces or capital letters or underscores)\n-   Tidy the combined data set\n-   Save the tidy data to the data folder in your project as `lotr_tidy`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br> <br>\n\n# 7. Your fourth code chunk should include code that:\n\n-   Reads in the *Female.csv* and *Male.csv* files and saves a single tidy data frame to file\n-   This should reproduce exactly the `lotr_tidy` data from above\n-   Compute the total number of words spoken by each race across the entire trilogy.\n-   Show these results in a table and a figure.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-words .cell tbl-cap='Total number of words spoken by each race across the entire LOTR trilogy'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br> <br>\n\n#### 8. Let's make messy data. Your fifth code chunk should include code that uses `lotr_tidy` and `pivot_wider()` to:\n\n-   Get one variable per `Race.` Save this as an object\n-   Get one variable per `Gender.` Save this as an object\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br> <br> <br> <br>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Part 2\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n<br> <br>\n\n#### 1. Tidy the *Project Reads* data\n\n-   Load the **Project_Reads_Scores.csv** file\n-   Remove columns 5-9, 24, and 25\n-   Filter to remove the rows in *student_id* that represent aggregate summaries\n-   Tidy the remaining dataset such that a case represents a score and percentage within a unit (i.e., *score* and *percentage* will be separate columns). Take a VERY close look at the data. You will be able to use the `names_sep` argument if you **first** `rename()` two columns. Identify those two columns first. Also, you will need to first `pivot_longer` and then `pivot_wider` in order to tidy properly. In these data, \"tidy\" is a row for each of the seven *units* for every *student_id*.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br> <br>\n\n#### 2. Produce a summary table of the mean percentage correct for each unit within test sites. Report the summary in a table.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
