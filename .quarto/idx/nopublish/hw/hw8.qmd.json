It contains data about courses, students, and their interactions with Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) for seven selected courses (called modules). Presentations of courses start in February and October - they are marked by \"B\" and \"J\" respectively. The dataset (tables) are connected using unique identifiers. All datasets are stored in the .csv format. Please check out the [OULAD](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset) site to learn more about the data and understand the keys.\n\n### 1. Start a new RStudio Project\n\n#### 1.1. Be sure to add a folder for \"data\" and \"scripts\".\n\n### 2. Data\n\n#### 2.1. Download the *studentInfo.csv*, *studentAssessment.csv*, and *assessments.csv* data from the [course website](https://jnese.github.io/intro-DS-R-fall-2023/data_list.html).\n\n#### 2.2. Place the files in the \"data\" folder in your project.\n\n#### 2.3. Read in the data.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: load-data\n\nstudentinfo <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"studentInfo.csv\"))\n\nstudentassessment <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"studentAssessment.csv\"))\n\nassessments <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"assessments.csv\"))\n\n```\n\n### 3. Join\n\n#### 3.1. Join the *studentInfo* data and the *studentAssessment* data. Name the joined data *student*.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: join-1\n\nstudent <- studentinfo %>% \n  left_join(studentassessment)\n```\n\n#### 3.2. What key(s) were used in the join?\n\n\n#### 3.3. How many rows are in this joined data? If that is different than the number of rows in the *studentInfo* data, why?\n\n\n#### 3.3. Join the newly created *student* data with the *assessments* data. Name the joined data *student*.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: join-2\n\nstudent <- student %>% \n  left_join(assessments)\n```\n\n#### 3.4. What key(s) were used in the join?\n\n\n#### 3.5. What new variables were added with this join?\n\n\n### 4. Wrangle\n\n#### 4.1. Create a new dataset named *student_tma* that consists only of TMA (Tutor Marked Assessment) assessments.\n\n```{r}\nstudent_tma <- student %>% \n  filter(assessment_type == \"TMA\")\n```\n\n#### 4.2. Create a new dataset named *student_tma_max* that contains the maximum (`max()`) TMA score for each student. (**Note.** Use `filter` rather than `summarize`.)\n\n```{r}\nstudent_tma_max <- student_tma %>%\n  group_by(id_student) %>% \n  filter(score == max(score, na.rm = TRUE)) \n```\n\n#### 4.3. How many rows are in this joined data? What does each row represent?\n\n\n#### 4.4. Create a dataset named *agg_tma_max* that contains the mean TMA score by \"highest_education\", \"disability\", and \"final_result.\"\n\n```{r}\nagg_tma_max <- student_tma_max %>%\n  group_by(highest_education, disability, final_result) %>%\n  summarize(tma_mean = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n### 5. Plot\n\n#### 5.1. Reproduce the following plot, using any theme and colors you want *except* for the defaults.\n\n```{r}\nagg_tma_max %>%\n  mutate(\n    highest_education = factor(highest_education, level = c(\"Post Graduate Qualification\", \"HE Qualification\", \"A Level or Equivalent\", \"Lower Than A Level\", \"No Formal quals\")),\n    final_result = factor(final_result, level = c(\"Withdrawn\", \"Fail\", \"Pass\", \"Distinction\"))) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(tma_mean, final_result, fill = disability)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  facet_wrap(~highest_education, ncol = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_colorblind() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average TMA Scores\",\n    subtitle = \"by education level, disability status, and final result designation\",\n    x = \"Mean Tutor Marked Assessment (TMA)\",\n    y = \"Final Result Designation\",\n    fill = \"Disability Status\",\n    caption = \"Data from Kuzilek, Hlosta, & Zdrahal (2017). \\nhttps://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset\"\n  )\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\n#| label: load-packages\n#| include: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n```\n\n# Getting Started\n\nThe data for this homework comes from the [Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset).
