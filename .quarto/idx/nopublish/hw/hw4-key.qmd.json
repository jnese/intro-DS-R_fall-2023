Produce a subset of the data (as a new object) that has the following characteristics:\n\n-   only one team (your choice)\n-   (try to you select a team that is currently still around, or it probably won't be interesting; see a list of current at <http://www.espn.com/mlb/teams>).\n-   data from 1980 to present (or as current as the dataset allows)\n-   includes 5 columns: `name`, `yearID`, `W`, `L`, `R`, `RA`. These 5 variables correspond to the team name, the year, wins, losses, runs scored, and runs allowed).\n\n```{r}\n#| label: p1\n\nteams <- Teams %>% \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\ncubs <- teams %>% \n    filter(name == \"Chicago Cubs\" & year_id >= 1980) %>% # Only one team (your choice) & data from 1980 to present\n    select(name, year_id, w, l, r, ra) #Includes 5 columns: name, yearID, W, L, R, RA\n\n\n# Create a new variable corresponding to the winning percentage for the team you chose over time\ncubs <- cubs %>% \n    mutate(w_pct = w / (w + l))\n```\n\n#### 2. Create a new variable corresponding to the winning percentage for the team you chose over time:\n\n$$w_{pct} = \\frac{wins}{wins + losses}$$ \\* Order by winning percentage: Least to greatest \\* Order by winning percentage: Greatest to least \\* Compute the `mean` and `standard deviation` of winning percentage\n\n```{r}\n#| label: p2\n\n# Order by winning percentage: Least to greatest\ncubs %>% \n  arrange(w_pct)\n\n# Order by winning percentage: greatest to least\ncubs %>% \n  arrange(desc(w_pct))\n\n# Compute the mean and standard deviation of winning percentage\ncubs %>% \n  summarize(mean_winning_pct = mean(w_pct),\n            sd_winning_pct = sd(w_pct))\n```\n\n#### 3. With the full *Teams* data:\n\n-   Compute the `mean` and `standard deviation` of winning percentage for each team\n-   Order by winning percentage, greatest to least\n\n```{r}\n#| label: p3\n\nteams %>% \n  mutate(w_pct = w / (w + l)) %>% # FIRST - compute the winning percentage\n  group_by(name) %>% \n  summarize(n = n(),\n            mean_winning_pct = mean(w_pct, na.rm = TRUE), # compute the average winning percentage for each team\n            sd_winning_pct = sd(w_pct, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% # compute the standard deviation of winning percentage for each team\n  arrange(desc(mean_winning_pct)) # Order by highest winning percentage\n```\n\n#### 4. Use the full data to reproduce the plot below\n\n```{r plot}\n#| label: plot\n\n# Please put the code for the plot in this chunk.\nteams %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  mutate(w_pct = w / (w + l)) %>% \n  filter(name == \"New York Yankees\" |\n         name == \"Detroit Tigers\" |\n         name == \"San Diego Padres\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(year_id, w_pct)) + \n  geom_line(aes(color = name)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    color = \"Team\"\n  )\n\n```\n\n# Part 2\n\n#### 1. Read in the following three datasets, using `{here}` and the package of your choice (`{rio}`, `{readr}`, `{haven}`, `{readxl}`)\n\n-   *sesame13.sav*\n-   *star.csv*\n-   *ais.xlsx*\n\n**Hint**: For the *ais.xlsx* data, look at the `skip` argument within the [`{readxl}`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/read_excel.html) help documentation.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: import\n\nsesame <- import(here(\"data\", \"sesame13.sav\"))\nstar <- import(here(\"data\", \"star.csv\"))\nais <- import(here(\"data\", \"ais.xlsx\"), skip = 15)\n```\n\n#### 2. Using the *ais* data, compute the average red blood cell count and average `bmi` by sport. Output these data as SPSS and EXCEL files.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: summary\n\nsmry <- ais %>% \n  group_by(sport) %>% \n  summarize(mean_rcc = mean(rcc),\n            mean_bmi = mean(bmi))\n\nexport(smry, \"summary_measures.sav\")\nexport(smry, \"summary_measures.xlsx\")\n\n```\n\n#### 3. Use the *sesame* data to answer the following question: Was the average female age higher in schools or at home?\n\n```{r}\n#| label: average\n\nsesame %>% \n  characterize() %>% \n  filter(sex == \"Female\") %>% \n  group_by(setting) %>% \n  summarize(mean_age = mean(age))\n# Answer: School\n\n```\n\n#### 4. First, how many rows and columns are in the *star* data? Next, remove outliers using a really poor method, just for practice, by eliminating students whose math (`tmathss`) scores were more than three standard deviations **above *or* below** the corresponding mean. How many rows are in the data now?\n\n```{r}\n#| label: challenge\n\ndim(star) # 5748 rows, 12 columns\n\nstar %>% \n  filter(tmathss <= mean(tmathss) + 3*sd(tmathss) &\n         tmathss >= mean(tmathss) - 3*sd(tmathss)) %>% \n  nrow()\n# Answer: 5743  \n  \n```\n\n#### 5. Use the *star* data to compute standardized math and reading scores; name these variables *tmathss* and *treadss*. To create standardized scores, for each variable (math and reading), subtract the mean from each observation and divide by the standard deviation: $x_s = \\frac{x_i - \\bar{X}}{sd(X)}$.\n\n-   Check that your computations were correct by computing the mean and standard deviation of each variable (they should be 0 and 1, respectively).\n-   Compute the mean of the standardized variable for all `sex`/`frl` combinations. (I'm asking you to extend what you know here. We haven't talked explicitly about how to do this yet, but you have seen examples).\n-   What do you make of these findings? Do you see an effect by `sex`? An `frl` effect (`frl` stands for free/reduced lunch, and is a rough proxy for household income)? Is there evidence of an interaction (i.e., that the effect of `frl` is greater for boys versus girls)?\n\n```{r}\n#| label: stats\n\nstar <- star %>% \n  mutate(stand_math = (tmathss - mean(tmathss)) / sd(tmathss),\n         stand_rdg  = (treadss - mean(treadss)) / sd(treadss))\n\nstar %>% \n  summarize(stand_math_mean = mean(stand_math),\n            stand_math_sd   = sd(stand_math),\n            stand_rdg_mean = mean(stand_rdg),\n            stand_rdg_sd   = sd(stand_rdg))\n\nstar %>% \n  group_by(sex, frl) %>% \n  summarize(stand_math_mean = mean(stand_math),\n            stand_math_sd   = sd(stand_math),\n            stand_rdg_mean = mean(stand_rdg),\n            stand_rdg_sd   = sd(stand_rdg))\n\n\n```\n\n#### Please submit you .qmd file, as well as the rendered .html file.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Create a RStudio Project on your machine\n\n-   Name the Project \"hw_4\"\n-   Within the Project create a folder for *data* and *scripts*.\n-   Download the following three datasets into the project *data* folder.\n    -   *sesame13.sav*\n    -   *star.csv*\n    -   *ais.xlsx*\n-   Save a hw_4.Rmd file in your *scripts* folder\n\n# Part 1\n\nInstall and load the package `{Lahman}`, which will give you access to the *Teams* data.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: teams_echo\n\n#install.packages(\"Lahman\")\nlibrary(rio)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(Lahman)\nlibrary(janitor)\n```\n\n#### 1.
