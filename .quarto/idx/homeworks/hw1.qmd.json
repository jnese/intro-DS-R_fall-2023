Please also load `{here}`, `{rio}`, and `{janitor}`. \nIf you get errors, you probably don't have one of the packages installed yet, so run `install.packages(\"package_name\")` in the console first.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: load-packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\nNote that you should get some messages printed out below that state all the packages that have been loaded. This is important to pay attention to. It says that both `{ggplot2}` and `{dplyr}` have been loaded, so you don't need explicit \ncalls to those packages.\n\n### Read in the data\n\nUse the code chunk below to:\n\n* Read in *sesame13.sav* using `{here}` and `{rio}`\n* Read in *star.csv* using `{here}` and `{readr}`\n* Apply the `clean_names()` function to both\n* Save each dataset as a separate object\n\n```{r}\n#| label: read-data\n\n\n```\n\n### `{ggplot2}` Peek\n\nMany packages also include data. We'll focus here on the **mpg** dataset, which comes from `{ggplot2}`. Run the following code to produce a scatterplot \n\n```{r}\n#| label: first-plot\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n### Help documentation\n\nLook at the help documentation for `geom_point()`. Use the help documentation to change the color of the points to \"gray70\". Start getting in the habit of running code within a code chunk rather than in the text/prose areas.  \n\nIn the code chunk below create a second scatterplot with the *mpg* dataset, this time with the number of cylinders displayed on the *x*-axis and the city miles per gallon on the *y*-axis. Also change the color of the points to \"gray70\".\n\n```{r}\n#| label: second-plot\n\n```\n\n### Inspecting Data\n\nThe *diamonds* dataset is also included with *ggplot2*. The code below will show the first six rows of the dataset.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: head-diamonds\n\nhead(diamonds)\n```\n\nLook at the help documentation and then use the code below to change the number of rows shown to 15.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: head-diamonds15\n \nhead(diamonds, )\n```\n\nCall a similar function that shows the last six rows of the dataset.
