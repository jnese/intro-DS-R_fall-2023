\section{Course Overview}\label{course-overview}}

This is the first course in a sequence of courses that will eventually
lead to a data science in educational research specialization. All
courses will be taught through
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{\texttt{R}}, a free and open-source
statistical computing environment. This course will introduce students
to\texttt{R} and \href{https://www.rstudio.com/}{RStudio}, version
control with \href{https://git-scm.com/}{git} and
\href{https://github.com/}{GitHub}, dynamic and reproducible workflows
with Quarto, and basic data wrangling and visualization with the
\href{https://www.tidyverse.org/}{\texttt{tidyverse}} suite of packages.

This course, and much of the materials prepared and content presented,
was originally developed by \href{https://www.datalorax.com/}{Daniel
Anderson}. In collaboration with Daniel Anderson,
\href{https://twitter.com/apreshill}{Alison Hill},
\href{https://twitter.com/old_man_chester}{Chester Ismay}, and
\href{https://andrewpbray.github.io/}{Andrew Bray}, helped design the
content for this course and the specialization as a whole.

\hypertarget{student-learning-outcomes}{%
\subsection{Student Learning Outcomes}\label{student-learning-outcomes}}

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand the R package ecosystem (how to find, install, load, and
  learn about package functionality)
\item
  Read ``flat'' (i.e., rectangular) datasets into R
\item
  Perform basic data wrangling and transformations in R, using the
  \texttt{tidyverse}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Leverage appropriate functions for introductory data science tasks
    (pipeline)
  \item
    ``clean up'' the dataset using scripts and reproducible workflows
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Use version control with R via GitHub
\item
  Use Quarto to create reproducible, dynamic reports
\item
  Understand and create different types of data visualizations
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{course-modality}{%
\subsubsection{Course Modality}\label{course-modality}}

This is an in-person course: that means that, unlike asynchronous
online/ASYNC WEB courses, we will meet during scheduled class meeting
times in (class location). I will accommodate absences as described in
the Absences policy below. If you need additional flexibility, UO
encourages you to consider ASYNC WEB courses. If you need accommodation
related to a medical or other disability, you can request those by
working with the Accessible Education Center.

\hypertarget{course-reading-materials-and-resources}{%
\subsection{Course Reading Materials and
Resources}\label{course-reading-materials-and-resources}}

\hypertarget{supplemental-learning}{%
\subsubsection{Supplemental Learning}\label{supplemental-learning}}

The best way to learn to use \texttt{R} is to be exposed to and use R,
so in this course we will use some supplemental content developed
outside this course. Specifically, we will be using some RStudio
Primers, and R-Bootcamp.

\hypertarget{rstudio-primers}{%
\paragraph{RStudio Primers}\label{rstudio-primers}}

We will use some of the
\href{https://posit.cloud/learn/primers}{primers} offered and developed
by RStudio, mostly around introducing \texttt{R} programming, data
visualization, and data cleaning in \texttt{R}. You will be working
through:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.2}{Programming Basics},
\item
  \href{https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.1}{Visualization Basics},
\item
  \href{https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/2.1}{Working with Tibbles},
  and
\item
  \href{https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/4.3}{Join Data Sets}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-bootcamp}{%
\paragraph{R-Bootcamp}\label{r-bootcamp}}

We will be using some content from the
\href{https://r-bootcamp.netlify.com/}{R-Bootcamp} course, developed by
\href{https://laderast.github.io/}{Ted Laderas} and
\href{http://jessicaminnier.com/}{Jessica Minnier}, to supplement
lectures. R-Bootcamp offers an introduction to manipulating and
visualizing data in R using the tidyverse suite of packages. You will be
working through:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/chapter2}{Chapter 2}, and
\item
  \href{https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/chapter3}{Chapter 3}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{codecademy}{%
\paragraph{Codecademy}\label{codecademy}}

We will also be using some content from the
\href{https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r}{Learn R} course through
\href{https://www.codecademy.com/}{Codecademy}. You will need to sign up
for a free account. Codecademy can be used as a place for you to
practice/grow the skills you learn in class, and a resource for your own
exploration of topics not covered by this class if you so choose. You
will be working through:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-r/lessons/introduction-to-r/exercises/why-r}{Introduction:
  Introduction to R Syntax},
\item
  \href{https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-r/lessons/intro-visualization-ggplot2-r/exercises/layers-and-geoms}{Fundamentals
  of Data Visualization with ggplot2: Introduction to Visualization with
  R},
\item

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\href{https://library.uoregon.edu/department-of-open-research/data-service}{UO

The team at the
\href{https://library.uoregon.edu/research-data-management/consultations}{UO
Libraries' Statistical Help Desk} is here to assist you with everything
from intermediate statistics-based coursework to dissertation-level
analysis. They are available this term \textbf{Monday through Friday
11am to 4pm} with in-person support at the
\href{https://map.uoregon.edu/f36893138}{Knight Library DREAM Lab} and
\href{https://uoregon.libcal.com/appointments?lid=916\&g=7803}{by
appointment} (in person or via Zoom). They cover a wide array of topics,
including introductory and advanced statistics, statistical software
(like R and Python), research design, GIS, git/GitHub, Zotero, and
qualitative software like Dedoose.

In addition to one-on-one assistance, they also provide a series of
workshops. This term, workshops encompass a range of topics from
\href{https://uoregon.libcal.com/event/11326378}{introduction to R} (!)
and \href{https://uoregon.libcal.com/event/11228199}{Python} to
effectively managing citations with Zotero. They also offer specialized
workshops upon request, including qualitative data analysis and GitHub
tutorials.

They host Friday lunch chats,
\href{https://uoregon.libcal.com/event/11326111}{\textbf{Coffee + Data
\&\& Code}} that provide an opportunity for students and faculty to
connect with like-minded peers from across the university. This term,
they're hosting a book club exploring
\href{https://uoregon.libcal.com/event/11326128}{How Statistics
Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century} and reading David
Salsburg's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_Tasting_Tea}{The
Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth
Century} (such a fun read!).

\hypertarget{learnr4free}{%
\paragraph{learnR4free}\label{learnr4free}}

\href{https://www.learnr4free.com/en/index.html}{learnR4free} includes
all sorts of resources (including books, videos, interactive websites,
papers) to learn \texttt{R} for free.

\hypertarget{r-ladies}{%
\paragraph{R-Ladies}\label{r-ladies}}

Regardless of how you identify, but particularly if you identify as a
woman or gender non-binary, connect with the global
\href{https://rladies.org/}{R-Ladies} organization. They are an
excellent organization of incredibly supportive individuals who
routinely share great information.

\hypertarget{rstudio-community}{%
\paragraph{RStudio Community}\label{rstudio-community}}

The \href{https://community.rstudio.com/}{RStudio community} is similar
to stackoverflow but is generally more friendly, willing to engage in
more philosophical and deeper discussions than ``how do you do X'', and
more opinionated about workflows/software design. This last part is
important because these discussions will generally be biased toward the
\texttt{\{tidyverse\}} philosophy, and so it's important that you
understand that going in. However, this course is also biased toward the
\texttt{\{tidyverse\}} philosophy, as I think it's a good one.
Stackoverflow is a very useful resource, but the RStudio community is a
better place for beginners to post questions.

As outlined in the \href{INCLUDE\%20LINK!!}{Weekly Schedule}, most class
meetings will include a homework assignment. Supplemental Learning
platforms (RStudio Primers, R-Bootcamp, and Codecademy) will also be
used as additional homework assignments, and the course will conclude
with a final project. More detail about each is provided below.

\hypertarget{homework-assignments-100-points}{%
\subsubsection{Homework Assignments (100
points)}\label{homework-assignments-100-points}}

There are 10 homework assignments during the course, which must be
submitted to the instructor prior to the start of the following class.
At 10 points per lab, these labs will be scored on a \textbf{``best
honest effort''} basis, which generally implies zero or full credit
(i.e., the assignment was or was not fully completed). However, many of
the homework assignments require students complete specific portions
before moving on to the next sections. If you find yourself stuck and
unable to proceed, please contact the instructor for help rather than
submitting incomplete work. Contacting the instructor is part of the
\textbf{``best honest effort''}, and can result in full credit for an
assignment even if the work is not fully complete. If the assignment is
not complete, and the student has not contacted the instructor for help,
it is likely to result is a score of zero.

In addition to providing supplemental support, four RStudio Primers, two
R-Bootcamp Chapters, and four Codecademy Lessons will be assigned and
scored as part of homework at 10 points each. For the RStudio Primers
and R-Bootcamp assignments you will submit a screenshot of a specific
part of each lesson as evidence of completion (see below). For the
Codecademy assignments you will submit a screenshot of the completed
lesson with a black checkmark in a yellow circle on your

\hypertarget{final-project-200-points-50}{%
\subsection{Final Project (200 points;
50\%)}\label{final-project-200-points-50}}

The final project in this class is a group project, requiring students
use a ``real world'' dataset to write, essentially, a miniature
manuscript, including an introduction (paragraph or two), methods,
results, and discussion (again, maybe 2-3 paragraphs). Ideally, students
would work with a dataset that includes variables they are interested in
using beyond just this class; however, if students do not have access to
a dataset, the instructor will provide one. Students who do not have
access to data should plan to meet with the instructor as soon as
possible so a dataset can be provided. Additionally, the dataset must be
able to be shared publicly, as the full project will be required to be
housed on GitHub and be fully reproducible. If making your data publicly
available is a problem for you, please contact the instructor as soon as
possible. We can work together to either find a dataset that will work
for you, or simulate a dataset that is similar to the data you'd like to
work with in reality (and then all your code should work for the real
dataset, but you can share the simulated data with your classmates).
Students are required to work in groups of 2-4 people. The final
assignment is assigned during the first class, and groups must be
finalized by the end of Week 2 (at which point students who have not
self-selected into groups will be randomly assigned).

\hypertarget{outline-15-points}{%
\subsubsection{Outline (15 points)}\label{outline-15-points}}

A basic outline of the final project is due at the end of Week 5. The
outline should include a description of the data to be used, a
discussion of what preparatory work will need to be done, and how the
requirements of the final project will be met. The outline is intended
to be low-stakes and is primarily designed to be a means for you to
obtain feedback on the feasibility of the project and areas to consider.

\hypertarget{draft-data-preparation-script-25-points}{%
\subsubsection{Draft Data Preparation Script (25
points)}\label{draft-data-preparation-script-25-points}}

At the end of Week 8, you must have a draft of the data preparation
complete, including moving the data from its raw to tidy form and a
variety of exploratory data visualizations. Final project must use the
following functions: \texttt{pivot\_longer()}, \texttt{select()},
\texttt{filter()}, \texttt{mutate()}, \texttt{pivot\_wider()},
\texttt{group\_by()}, and \texttt{summarize()}.

\hypertarget{peer-review-of-data-preparation-script-25-points}{%
\subsubsection{Peer Review of Data Preparation Script (25
points)}\label{peer-review-of-data-preparation-script-25-points}}

Following the submission of the data preparation scripts, you will be
assigned to review your peers' code. The purpose of this exercise is to
learn from each other. Programming is an immensely open-ended enterprise
and there are lots of winding paths that all ultimately end up at the
same destination. During your peer review, you must note (a) at least
three areas of strength, (b) at least one thing you learned from
reviewing their script, and (c) at least one and no more than three
areas for improvement. Making your code publicly available can feel
daunting. The purpose of this portion of the final project is to help us
all learn from each other, not to denigrate. Under no circumstances will
negative comments be tolerated. Any comments that could be perceived as
negative, and outside the scope of the code, will result in an immediate
score of zero. Be constructive in your feedback. Be kind. We are all
learning.

\hypertarget{final-project-presentation-25-points}{%
\subsubsection{Final Project Presentation (25
points)}\label{final-project-presentation-25-points}}

Each group will present on their final project during Week 10, which is
expected to still be in progress. These presentations are expected to be
informal, and emphasize what learning occurred during the project.
Specifically, the presentations are to commiserate with each other about
the failures and challenges experienced along the way, while also
celebrating the successes. Learning R is a difficult task, and we should
all take solace knowing that others are struggling along with us. The
final presentation should be equal parts ``journey'' and substantive
findings/conclusions/results. Students are expected to present for
approximately 10 minutes each (20-40 minutes per group), although the
time may change depending on the enrollment of the class.

\hypertarget{final-paper-110}{%
\subsubsection{Final Paper (110)}\label{final-paper-110}}

The purpose of the final project is to allow students an opportunity to
demonstrate all the skills they have learned throughout the course. The
final project must (a) be a reproducible and dynamic R Markdown document
with references to the extant literature; (b) be housed on GitHub, with
contributions from all authors obvious; (c) demonstrate moving data from
its raw ``messy'' format to a tidy data format through the R Markdown
file, but not in the final document; (d) include at least two
exploratory data visualizations, and (e) include at least summary
statistics of the data in tables, although fitted models of any sort are
an added bonus (not literally, there are not extra points for fitting a
model). The points for the final project are broken down as follows.

\end{longtable*}

I will investigate the commits made by different authors when evaluating
the final project. If it is obvious that one person did not utilize
GitHub, and instead added all of their contributions through a single or
only a few commits, I will dock points from that individual. There
should be numerous commits by each author, and they should be roughly
even in terms of contribution activity (which GitHub has metrics to
track, both in terms of the number of commits as well as the number of
lines modified).

\hypertarget{communicating-with-me-how-and-why}{%
\subsection{Communicating with Me: How and
Why}\label{communicating-with-me-how-and-why}}

\textbf{How will I communicate with you?} Our class will communicate
through our Canvas site. Announcements and emails are archived there,
automatically forwarded to your UO email, and can even reach you by
text. Check and adjust your settings under Account \textgreater{}
Notifications.

When I need to get in touch with individual students, I do so through
email.

When giving feedback on assignments, I do so in Canvas, and turnaround
time for feedback is generally one week.

\textbf{How can you communicate with me?} If your question (or comment)
is about a technical challenge with Canvas or another technology, please
contact the UO Service Portal. IF it about course content or activities,
about something personal, time sensitive, or something else that doesn't
feel like it fits above, please reach out to me by email. I try to
respond to questions within one business day.

\textbf{Why should you communicate with me?} I enjoy talking with
students about our course material! Are you confused or excited about
something? Wondering how what we're learning relates to current events,
career choices, or other classes you can take UO? Please be in touch!
Please also be in touch to tell me how you are doing in the course. If
you are having trouble with some aspect of it, I would like to
strategize with you. I believe every student can succeed in this course,
and I care about your success.

\hypertarget{classroom-community-expectations}{%
\subsection{Classroom Community
Expectations}\label{classroom-community-expectations}}

\textbf{Participate and Contribute:} All students are expected to
participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the learning
environment. This entails preparing, following instructions, and
engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others. While all students
should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of
participation activities support learning. Participation might look like
speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups as well as
submitting questions prior to class or engaging with Discussion posts.
We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria
for contributions in our first weeks of the term.

\textbf{Expect and Respect Diversity:} All classes at the University of
Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and
approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that
undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity,
gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or
socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate
disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines
and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our
learning community.

\textbf{Help Everyone Learn:} Part of how we learn together is by
learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient
with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded
to receiving help and feedback from others. Don't hesitate to contact me
to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn
better.

\textbf{Guidelines for using Canvas Discussion:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use subject lines that clearly communicate the content of your post -
  Write concisely, and be aware that humor or sarcasm doesn't always
  translate in writing.
\item
  Be supportive and considerate when replying to others' posts. This
  means avoiding use of jargon or inappropriate language, and it means
  disagreeing with respect and providing clear rationale or evidence to
  support your different view.\\
\item
  Keep focused on the topic and reference readings and other class
  materials to support your points (as applicable).\\
\item
  Try to use correct spelling and grammar and proofread your
  submissions. After submitting, use the edit feature to make
  corrections and resubmit (don't create a new or duplicate post that
  corrects your error).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{absences}{%
\subsection{Absences}\label{absences}}

This is a face-to-face course. Attendance is important because we will
develop our knowledge through in-class activities that require your
active engagement. We'll have discussions, small-group activities, and
do other work during class that will be richer for your presence, and
that you won't be able to benefit from if you are not there. Excessive
absences make it impossible to learn well and succeed in the course.
While there is not an automatic grade deduction for missing classes, it
is unlikely that students who miss X or more classes will be able pass
this course.

We know our UO community will still be navigating COVID-19, and some
students will need to isolate and rest if they get COVID. Please take
absences only when necessary, so when they are necessary, your prior
attendance will have positioned you for success.

Attendance at all class and discussion groups is expected and required.
Students must contact the instructor in case of illness or emergencies
that preclude attending class sessions. Messages can be left on the
instructor's e-mail at any time of the day or night, prior to class. If
you are unable to complete an assignment due to a personal and/or family
emergency, you should contact your instructor as soon as possible.

If you must miss a class please fill out the

report form}.

\hypertarget{generative-artificial-intelligence-use}{%
\subsection{Generative Artificial Intelligence
Use}\label{generative-artificial-intelligence-use}}

Students can use GenAI tools in this class to help with course work and
assignments. However, if you use a GenAI tool, you need to document your
use, including the tool you use and when, where, and how in your work
process you used it (for example: ``I used ChatGPT to generate this part
of my code, which I then revised before submitting''). In certain cases,
as part of your documentation, I may ask you to submit any GenAI results
you obtained, so you need to keep GenAI-created drafts and logs of your
interactions with GenAI tools; failure to provide such documentation may
result in a grade reduction in certain instances.

Along with documentation of your GenAI use, you are also required to
cite GenAI if you use any GenAI-created content in your work
submissions, for example text or images or graphics generated by GenAI
tools. That is, you need to treat GenAI just like other sources such as
books, articles, videos, etc.

\hypertarget{children-in-class}{%
\subsection{Children in Class}\label{children-in-class}}

I understand the difficulty in balancing academic, work, and family
commitments and I want you to succeed. Here are my policies regarding
children in class.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as necessary.
\item
  Non-nursing babies and older children are welcome whenever alternate
  arrangements cannot be made. As a parent, I understand that
  babysitters fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, and
  other issues arise that leave parents with few other options. Please
  do not bring a sick child into class.
\item
  In cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers to
  sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend
  to your child's needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats
  near the door for your parenting classmates.
\item
  All students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming
  environment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children
  to class.
\end{itemize}

I understand that sleep deprivation and exhaustion are among the most
difficult aspects of parenting young children. The struggle of balancing
school, work, childcare, and graduate school is tiring, and I will do my
best to accommodate any such issues while maintaining the same high
expectations for all students enrolled in the class. Please do not
hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

\hypertarget{using-pronouns-and-personal-preference}{%
\subsection{Using Pronouns and Personal
Preference}\label{using-pronouns-and-personal-preference}}

Please feel safe to share your pronouns, or the words you want to be
called when people aren't using your name. Like names, pronouns are an
important part of how we identify that deserves to be respected. And I
recognize that assuming someone's gender can be hurtful, especially to
members of our community who are transgender, genderqueer, or
non-binary. As a community, we are all learning together about the
importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans community on
campus. Please discuss the pronouns you wish to be used with me so I can
address you respectfully. Please visit this university website for more

Life at college can be very complicated. Students often feel overwhelmed
or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with
relationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If
you're facing such challenges, you don't need to handle them on your own
- there's help and support on campus.

As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I will
express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to resources
that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the details of
what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I care and that
help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to do - for
yourself and those you care about.

help students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. . If you
need general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with
another student who has been in the same place as you, visit the Duck
Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from one of
the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates.

University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff
members to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide
identity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity}{%
\subsection{Academic Integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

The \href{https://dos.uoregon.edu/conduct}{University Student Conduct
Code} defines academic misconduct, which includes using unauthorized
help on assignments and examinations, the use of sources without
acknowledgment, and recording class without ``the express written
permission of the instructor(s).'' Academic misconduct is prohibited at
UO. I will report all suspected misconduct to the Office of Student
Conduct and Community Standards. If the Office finds a student has
committed misconduct, consequences can include of the relevant
assignment or exam, or of the course.

While unauthorized help and use of sources without citation is
prohibited, learning together and citing sources is crucial! Each
assignment and assessment will have a note about whether and how you
might work with others so that you can clearly act with academic
integrity. All assignments will use APA citation (preferred), and you
can find support in using {[}citation method{]} at the
\href{https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism/whycite\#s-lg-box-8000742}{UO
Libraries' Citation Guides research guide}.

If at any point in the term you are unsure about whether a behavior
aligns with academic integrity in our course, please contact me. I view
student questions about academic integrity as a desire to act with
integrity, so I welcome your questions.

learning experiences. I value this feedback and am continually improving
the course with students' responses in mind. The key parts of the survey

feedback and about the teaching practices that stand out to you. Thank
you for your thoughtful reflections!
