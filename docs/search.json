I will accommodate absences as described in the Absences policy below. If you need additional flexibility, UO encourages you to consider ASYNC WEB courses. If you need accommodation related to a medical or other disability, you can request those by working with the Accessible Education Center."

    "text": "Resources\n\nSupplemental Learning\nThe best way to learn to use R is to be exposed to and use R, so in this course we will use some supplemental content developed outside this course. Specifically, we will be using some RStudio Primers, and R-Bootcamp.\n\nRStudio Primers\nWe will use some of the primers offered and developed by RStudio, mostly around introducing R programming, data visualization, and data cleaning in R. You will be working through:\n\nProgramming Basics,\nVisualization Basics,\nWorking with Tibbles, and\nJoin Data Sets.\n\n\n\nR-Bootcamp\nWe will be using some content from the R-Bootcamp course, developed by Ted Laderas and Jessica Minnier, to supplement lectures. R-Bootcamp offers an introduction to manipulating and visualizing data in R using the tidyverse suite of packages. You will be working through:\n\nChapter 2, and\nChapter 3.\n\n\n\nCodecademy\nWe will also be using some content from the Learn R course through Codecademy. You will need to sign up for a free account. Codecademy can be used as a place for you to practice/grow the skills you learn in class, and a resource for your own exploration of topics not covered by this class if you so choose. You will be working through:\n\nIntroduction: Introduction to R Syntax,\nFundamentals of Data Visualization with ggplot2: Introduction to Visualization with R,\nLearn R: Aggregates in R, and\nLearn R: Joining Tables in R\n\n\n\n\nHelpful People/Groups\n\nUO Libraries Data Services\nThe team at the UO Libraries’ Statistical Help Desk is here to assist you with everything from intermediate statistics-based coursework to dissertation-level analysis. They are available this term Monday through Friday 11am to 4pm with in-person support at the Knight Library DREAM Lab and by appointment (in person or via Zoom). They cover a wide array of topics, including introductory and advanced statistics, statistical software (like R and Python), research design, GIS, git/GitHub, Zotero, and qualitative software like Dedoose.\nIn addition to one-on-one assistance, they also provide a series of workshops. This term, workshops encompass a range of topics from introduction to R (!) and Python to effectively managing citations with Zotero. They also offer specialized workshops upon request, including qualitative data analysis and GitHub tutorials.\nThey host Friday lunch chats, Coffee + Data && Code that provide an opportunity for students and faculty to connect with like-minded peers from across the university. This term, they’re hosting a book club exploring How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century and reading David Salsburg’s The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century (such a fun read!).\n\n\nlearnR4free\nlearnR4free includes all sorts of resources (including books, videos, interactive websites, papers) to learn R for free.\n\n\nR-Ladies\nRegardless of how you identify, but particularly if you identify as a woman or gender non-binary, connect with the global R-Ladies organization. They are an excellent organization of incredibly supportive individuals who routinely share great information.\n\n\nRStudio Community\nThe RStudio community is similar to stackoverflow but is generally more friendly, willing to engage in more philosophical and deeper discussions than “how do you do X”, and more opinionated about workflows/software design. This last part is important because these discussions will generally be biased toward the {tidyverse} philosophy, and so it’s important that you understand that going in. However, this course is also biased toward the {tidyverse} philosophy, as I think it’s a good one. Stackoverflow is a very useful resource, but the RStudio community is a better place for beginners to post questions."

At 10 points per lab, these labs will be scored on a “best honest effort” basis, which generally implies zero or full credit (i.e., the assignment was or was not fully completed). However, many of the homework assignments require students complete specific portions before moving on to the next sections. If you find yourself stuck and unable to proceed, please contact the instructor for help rather than submitting incomplete work. Contacting the instructor is part of the “best honest effort”, and can result in full credit for an assignment even if the work is not fully complete. If the assignment is not complete, and the student has not contacted the instructor for help, it is likely to result is a score of zero.\n\n\nSupplemental Learning Platforms\n\nRStudio Primers, R-Bootcamp Chapters, & Codecademy-Learn R (100 points)\nIn addition to providing supplemental support, four RStudio Primers, two R-Bootcamp Chapters, and four Codecademy Lessons will be assigned and scored as part of homework at 10 points each. For the RStudio Primers and R-Bootcamp assignments you will submit a screenshot of a specific part of each lesson as evidence of completion (see below). For the Codecademy assignments you will submit a screenshot of the completed lesson with a black checkmark in a yellow circle on your syllabus page. This information is also in the Weekly Schedule.\n\nRStudio Primers Screenshot to submit (10 points each)\n\nProgramming Basics: screenshot of Types &gt; Character or object?\nVisualization Basics: screenshot of A code template &gt; A graphing template\nWorking with Tibbles: screenshot of tidyverse &gt; Quiz\nJoin Data Sets: screenshot of Mutating Joins &gt; Test your comprehension\n\n\n\nR-Bootcamp Screenshots to submit (10 points each)\n\nChapter 2: screenshot of part 13\nChapter 3: screenshot of part 21\nChapter 4: screenshot of part 7\n\n\n\nCodecademy Screenshots to submit (10 points each)\n\nIntroduction: Introduction to R Syntax: screenshot of completion checkmark (example)\nFundamentals of Data Visualization with ggplot2: Introduction to Visualization with R: screenshot of completion checkmark\nLearn R: Aggregates in R: screenshot of completion checkmark\nLearn R: Joining Tables in R: screenshot of completion checkmark"

    "section": "Final Project (200 points; 50%)",
    "text": "Final Project (200 points; 50%)\nThe final project in this class is a group project, requiring students use a “real world” dataset to write, essentially, a miniature manuscript, including an introduction (paragraph or two), methods, results, and discussion (again, maybe 2-3 paragraphs). Ideally, students would work with a dataset that includes variables they are interested in using beyond just this class; however, if students do not have access to a dataset, the instructor will provide one. Students who do not have access to data should plan to meet with the instructor as soon as possible so a dataset can be provided. Additionally, the dataset must be able to be shared publicly, as the full project will be required to be housed on GitHub and be fully reproducible. If making your data publicly available is a problem for you, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. We can work together to either find a dataset that will work for you, or simulate a dataset that is similar to the data you’d like to work with in reality (and then all your code should work for the real dataset, but you can share the simulated data with your classmates). Students are required to work in groups of 2-4 people. The final assignment is assigned during the first class, and groups must be finalized by the end of Week 2 (at which point students who have not self-selected into groups will be randomly assigned).\n\nOutline (15 points)\nA basic outline of the final project is due at the end of Week 5. The outline should include a description of the data to be used, a discussion of what preparatory work will need to be done, and how the requirements of the final project will be met. The outline is intended to be low-stakes and is primarily designed to be a means for you to obtain feedback on the feasibility of the project and areas to consider.\n\n\nDraft Data Preparation Script (25 points)\nAt the end of Week 8, you must have a draft of the data preparation complete, including moving the data from its raw to tidy form and a variety of exploratory data visualizations. Final project must use the following functions: pivot_longer(), select(), filter(), mutate(), pivot_wider(), group_by(), and summarize().\n\n\nPeer Review of Data Preparation Script (25 points)\nFollowing the submission of the data preparation scripts, you will be assigned to review your peers’ code. The purpose of this exercise is to learn from each other. Programming is an immensely open-ended enterprise and there are lots of winding paths that all ultimately end up at the same destination. During your peer review, you must note (a) at least three areas of strength, (b) at least one thing you learned from reviewing their script, and (c) at least one and no more than three areas for improvement. Making your code publicly available can feel daunting. The purpose of this portion of the final project is to help us all learn from each other, not to denigrate. Under no circumstances will negative comments be tolerated. Any comments that could be perceived as negative, and outside the scope of the code, will result in an immediate score of zero. Be constructive in your feedback. Be kind. We are all learning.\n\n\nFinal Project Presentation (25 points)\nEach group will present on their final project during Week 10, which is expected to still be in progress. These presentations are expected to be informal, and emphasize what learning occurred during the project. Specifically, the presentations are to commiserate with each other about the failures and challenges experienced along the way, while also celebrating the successes. Learning R is a difficult task, and we should all take solace knowing that others are struggling along with us. The final presentation should be equal parts “journey” and substantive findings/conclusions/results. Students are expected to present for approximately 10 minutes each (20-40 minutes per group), although the time may change depending on the enrollment of the class.\n\n\nFinal Paper (110)\nThe purpose of the final project is to allow students an opportunity to demonstrate all the skills they have learned throughout the course. The final project must (a) be a reproducible and dynamic R Markdown document with references to the extant literature; (b) be housed on GitHub, with contributions from all authors obvious; (c) demonstrate moving data from its raw “messy” format to a tidy data format through the R Markdown file, but not in the final document; (d) include at least two exploratory data visualizations, and (e) include at least summary statistics of the data in tables, although fitted models of any sort are an added bonus (not literally, there are not extra points for fitting a model). The points for the final project are broken down as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Final Paper Rubric\n    \n    \n    \n      Criteria\n      Points Possible\n    \n  \n  \n    Writing\n\n\n    Abstract\n\n5\n    Introduction\n\n5\n    Methods\n\n5\n    Results\n\n5\n    Discussion\n\n5\n    References\n\n5\n    Code\n\n\n    Document is fully reproducible\n\n25\n    Demonstrate use of inline code\n\n5\n    At least two data visualizations\n\n10 (5 pts each)\n    Demonstrate tidying messy data using:\n\n\n    pivot_longer()\n\n5\n    mutate()\n\n5\n    select()`` and ``filter()\n\n5\n    pivot_wider()\n\n5\n    At least one table of descriptive statistics\n\n10\n    group_by()\n\n5\n    summarize()\n\n5\n    Total\n\n110\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nI will investigate the commits made by different authors when evaluating the final project. If it is obvious that one person did not utilize GitHub, and instead added all of their contributions through a single or only a few commits, I will dock points from that individual. There should be numerous commits by each author, and they should be roughly even in terms of contribution activity (which GitHub has metrics to track, both in terms of the number of commits as well as the number of lines modified)."

While all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups as well as submitting questions prior to class or engaging with Discussion posts. We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions in our first weeks of the term.\nExpect and Respect Diversity: All classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our learning community.\nHelp Everyone Learn: Part of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better.\nGuidelines for using Canvas Discussion:\n\nUse subject lines that clearly communicate the content of your post - Write concisely, and be aware that humor or sarcasm doesn’t always translate in writing.\nBe supportive and considerate when replying to others’ posts. This means avoiding use of jargon or inappropriate language, and it means disagreeing with respect and providing clear rationale or evidence to support your different view.\n\nKeep focused on the topic and reference readings and other class materials to support your points (as applicable).\n\nTry to use correct spelling and grammar and proofread your submissions. After submitting, use the edit feature to make corrections and resubmit (don’t create a new or duplicate post that corrects your error)."
